**The Yin and Yang-Like Clinical Implications of the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B Gene Cluster in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia**

González-Gil C, Ribera J, Ribera JM, Genescà E. *Genes (Basel).* 2021.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435487/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33435487) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/1/79)

This comprehensive review examines the dual prognostic role of deletions at the 9p21.3 locus, which simultaneously disrupts *CDKN2A* (encoding p16INK4a), *ARF* (encoding p14ARF), and *CDKN2B* (encoding p15INK4b). Deletions at this locus are the most frequent structural alteration in T-cell ALL and account for ~30% of copy number changes in B-cell precursor ALL. The authors synthesize data across pediatric and adult cohorts, animal models, and discuss how these alterations serve as both prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets — a "yin and yang" relationship reflecting context-dependent clinical outcomes.

**Transformation of Primary Murine Peritoneal Mast Cells by Constitutive KIT Activation Is Accompanied by Loss of Cdkn2a/Arf Expression**

Capellmann S, Sonntag R, Schüler H, et al. *Frontiers in Immunology.* 2023.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37063827/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37063827) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10097954)

This study developed a transformed murine mast cell line (PMC-306) from primary peritoneal mast cells and found that oncogenic transformation driven by constitutive KIT signaling is accompanied by complete loss of *Cdkn2a* and *Arf* expression. The transformed cells show markedly accelerated cell cycle progression while retaining some functional mast cell characteristics. Sustained SCF supplementation in bone marrow-derived mast cells recapitulated the loss of expression, establishing a causal link between KIT pathway hyperactivation and suppression of these two critical tumor suppressors.

**ARF Alters PAF1 Complex Integrity to Selectively Repress Oncogenic Transcription Programs upon p53 Loss**

Wang J, Fendler NL, Shukla A, et al. *Molecular Cell.* 2024.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532099/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/39532099)

This high-impact study reveals a p53-independent mechanism by which ARF suppresses tumor growth. ARF forms homo-oligomers that bind the PAF1 transcriptional elongation complex, triggering its disassembly and reducing its interaction with RNA Polymerase II. ARF also targets RUNX1 to selectively repress pro-growth gene programs, particularly in the GDF/BMP signaling axis. In cells lacking both p53 and ARF, PAF1c and RUNX1 cooperate to drive aberrant proliferation — and blocking GDF/BMP signaling or RUNX1 substantially reduces this proliferation, pointing to new therapeutic vulnerabilities in double-null tumors.

**Loss of p14 Diminishes Immunogenicity in Melanoma via Non-Canonical Wnt Signaling by Reducing the Peptide Surface Density**

Wohlfarth J, Kosnopfel C, Faber D, et al. *Molecular Oncology.* 2024.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38807304/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/38807304)

This study investigates how reduced p14ARF expression shapes the immune landscape in melanoma. Counter-intuitively, p14ARF loss leads to globally enhanced HLA-I surface expression but *decreased* presentation of cognate melanoma differentiation antigens, making tumor cells less recognizable to T cells despite appearing more "antigen-presenting." The mechanism involves non-canonical Wnt5a signaling reducing peptide surface density. Paradoxically, this immunologically unfavorable state correlates with improved patient outcomes, highlighting the complex relationship between antigen presentation, p14ARF status, and clinical prognosis.

**The SIRT7–Nucleolus Connection in Cancer: ARF Enters the Fray**

Tarighi S, Kumari P, Vaquero A, Braun T, Ianni A. *Molecular and Cellular Oncology.* 2024.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036727/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/39036727)

This commentary/research report establishes a new connection between the nucleolar deacetylase SIRT7 and ARF. The authors demonstrate that SIRT7 destabilizes ARF within the nucleolus, thereby relieving a key brake on ribosome biosynthesis and promoting cancer progression. The finding positions nucleolar SIRT7 as a regulatory node that functionally antagonizes ARF's tumor-suppressive activity, and suggests that SIRT7 inhibition could restore ARF function as an anti-cancer strategy.

**Derivation of Human Primary Prostate Epithelial Cell Lines by Differentially Targeting the CDKN2A Locus Along with Expression of hTERT**

Wasserman JS, Fowle H, Hashmi R, et al. *Scientific Reports.* 2024.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39223207/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/39223207) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71306-5)

This methods paper describes a CRISPR-based approach to immortalize normal human prostate epithelial cells by selectively inactivating either p16INK4a alone, or both p16INK4a and p14ARF, at the *CDKN2A* locus in combination with hTERT overexpression. The resulting cell lines display basal cell characteristics, maintain normal cell cycle checkpoints, and closely resemble primary prostate basal cells by gene expression profiling. The work provides a reproducible tool for studying prostate biology and the distinct contributions of each *CDKN2A* isoform to cellular immortalization.

**Elevated Type I Interferon Signaling Defines the Proliferative Advantage of ARF and p53 Mutant Tumor Cells**

Mabry A, Kuzmicki CE, O'Brien A, Maggi LB Jr, Weber JD. *Molecular and Cellular Biology.* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40351125/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/40351125)

This study identifies a dependency of ARF/p53 double-null tumor cells on JAK1–STAT1 signaling. Cells lacking both ARF and p53 constitutively activate interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through JAK1-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation, which confers a proliferative advantage. Treatment with selective JAK1 inhibitors (ruxolitinib or baricitinib) suppresses ISG induction and significantly reduces proliferation in these cells. Human tumors with ARF/p53 co-deletion show elevated type I interferon signatures, suggesting JAK1 inhibition as a clinically actionable vulnerability for this aggressive tumor genotype.

**Dysregulated CDKN2A–MDM2–p53 Axis in B Cells of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**

Azizan A, Farhadi E, Faezi ST, et al. *International Immunopharmacology.* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39970716/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/39970716)

This study extends the relevance of CDKN2A beyond oncology by demonstrating its dysregulation in an autoimmune context. In B cells from SLE patients, *TP53* and *CDKN2A* are significantly downregulated both at baseline and following activation, while *MDM2* is upregulated at baseline. The authors propose that reduced CDKN2A and p53 coupled with elevated MDM2 promotes pathological B cell survival in SLE, contributing to disease activity — and that MDM2 expression levels correlate with clinical severity markers.

**Somatic CRISPR Tumorigenesis and Multiomic Analysis Reveal a Pentose Phosphate Pathway Disruption Vulnerability in MPNSTs**

McGivney GR, Brockman QR, Borcherding N, et al. *Science Advances.* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40802750/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/40802750) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12346278)

Using somatic CRISPR-based tumor induction in mice, this study models NF1/CDKN2A-deleted malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and performs multiomic profiling to identify metabolic vulnerabilities. CDKN2A-deleted MPNSTs show strong dependency on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NRF2-driven NADPH metabolism. Inhibiting G6PD, the rate-limiting PPP enzyme, slows tumor growth and sensitizes cells to chemotherapy, identifying the NRF2–PPP axis as a targetable vulnerability in this aggressive and treatment-resistant sarcoma.

**Paired Tumor-Normal Sequencing Provides Insights into the CDKN2A-Associated Tumor Spectrum**

Breen KE, Mehta N, Ravichandran V, et al. *NPJ Precision Oncology.* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41258420/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/41258420) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12630871)

Among 71,868 cancer patients analyzed, 69 (0.1%) carried germline pathogenic variants in *CDKN2A*. Paired tumor-normal sequencing revealed biallelic inactivation in 70.2% of assessable tumors, predominantly through loss of heterozygosity. Variants affecting p16INK4a were most common (87%), but the tumor spectrum extended well beyond the classically associated melanoma and pancreatic cancer to include lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and other malignancies, underscoring the breadth of CDKN2A's tumor-suppressive role across tissue types.

**Abnormal Nuclear and Nucleolar Immunoreactivity of p16INK4a Represents a Frameshift Alteration in CDKN2A: The E6H4 Clone Recognizes the "p14ARF::p16INK4a" Chimeric Protein**

Mitsui A, Kashima J, Ryo E, et al. *Virchows Archiv.* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41339993/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/41339993)

This diagnostic pathology study characterizes an unusual immunostaining pattern produced by frameshift mutations in exon 2 of *CDKN2A*. Such mutations inactivate p16INK4a while shifting the reading frame into the *ARF* coding sequence, generating a chimeric p14ARF::p16INK4a fusion protein that produces strong nuclear and nucleolar staining with the widely-used E6H4 antibody clone. This pattern can be misinterpreted as evidence of HPV-driven carcinogenesis, with serious downstream diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The paper establishes criteria to distinguish this artefact from true HPV-associated overexpression.

**Drivers of Pancreatic Cancer: Beyond the Big 4**

Porcza LM, Ballesteros-Cillero R, Lam LT, Maiello C, Leslie NR. *Cancers (Basel).* 2025.
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40723241/) · [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/40723241) · [Full text (Open Access)](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12293165)

This review critically appraises pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) genetics, where *CDKN2A* is one of four dominant drivers alongside *KRAS*, *TP53*, and *SMAD4*. The authors argue that a focus solely on genetic mutations misses important non-genetic mechanisms of tumor suppressor silencing: PTEN protein loss occurs in >50% of PDAC cases despite rare genetic mutation, and KDM6A and ARID1A are frequently lost at the protein level without accompanying DNA changes. The paper makes a case for broadening PDAC analysis beyond the canonical four drivers to uncover new therapeutic opportunities.
